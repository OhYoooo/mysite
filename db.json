If you are new to redux, [here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) is the guide to dive before we start our topic.<!-- more -->\n\nIn a complex javascript application, asynchronous function is always one of the most annoying part where encounters tons of bugs. If not handle them properly, the app usually ends up with ***call back hell***.\n</br>\n\n## **Haven't heard of *CallBack Hell*?**\nWell, in javascript, the only way you can suspend a computation and have the rest operations doing later is to put the rest operations into a callback function. This callback function usually returns a **`Promise`** (And has a type of **`Promise<any>`**). In order to easily mark those async functions, after ***ES6*** javascript provides extra modifiers **`async`** and **`await`**, which actually wraps up the original utilities of promise and makes it more readable to programmers. Hummm, sounds like things are going better... ~~**NO!! It doesn't resolve anything!**~~ The core problem leads to a callback hell is the hierarchical async calls, for example\n\nyou have some simple synchronous functions which are in a chain to accomplish some logics:\n```javascript\na = getSomething();\nb = getMore(a);\nc = getMoreAndMore(b);\n...\n```\nIt looks fine for now, but what if they all turn out to be async? Then you have to follow the callback style to make them operate one right after another is done:\n```javascript\ngetSomthing(function(a) {\n    getMore(a, function(b) {\n        getMoreAndMore(b, function(c) {\n            //keep going...\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\nOr you prefer ***ES6***:\n```javascript\nasync function getSomething(a) {\n    await b = ToDo(a);\n    return await getMore((b) => {\n        return await ToDo(b);\n    }).then((c) => {\n        return await ToDo(c);\n    }).then(...);\n}\n```\nLooks really confused? This will getting even uglier if we are using callbacks in loops. \n</br>\n## Redux Thunks\nBack to our redux app, we usually want to update some states after an async call to inform the UI that the data is ready to be fetched. That is always achieved by dispatching an action from the component to the reducer:\n```javascript\nasync const callAPI = () => {\n    ...\n    return response;\n};\n...\nasync const updateUI = (...params) => {\n    const res = await callAPI();\n    if (res.status === 200)\n        dispatch({type: \"UPDATE\", isSuccess: true});\n};\n...\nrender({\n    ...\n    this.props.isSuccess?\n        showData() : showError()\n});\n```\nThis isn't bad, but we are always looking for something better. An advanced way to rewrite it is using redux middleware. ***Middleware*** is somewhere you can put the code after the framework receives a request and before it generates a response. For example, we want to add a logger in the redux store so that when the store catches an action, before it returns the new state, the logger can log the previous state and the new generated state. This is what can be added as a middleware:\n```javascript\nfunction logger(store) {\n    return function wrapDispatch (next) {\n        return function dispatchAndLog (action) {\n            console.log(\"dispatching.. \", action);\n            let result = next(action);\n            console.log(\"new state\", store.getState());\n            return result;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThere are more advanced ways to add a logger. If you are interested, please refer to the [offical documentation](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware). With our middleware, the previous example can be written in a cleaner way:\n```javascript\nconst callAPI = () => {\n    return((dispatch) => {\n        dispatch(startCallingApiAction);\n        actualCallApi().then(data => {\n            dispatch(successAction(data));\n        }).fail(err => {\n            dispatch(failedAction(err));\n        });\n    });\n};\n```\nThe successful response data is wrapped in the payload of the action, sent to the reducer. Once the store updates the data, it will be mapped as a prop back to the component and request for a rerender. This middleware is also called ***thunk***. By applying thunk to decouple the presentation layer, we can get rid of most of the side effects in components, instead, managing and orchestrating side effects in thunks.\n\nThis is great, so why are we even considering ***saga***? Well, one of the advantages of middleware is that it can be chained. Every middleware mounted in redux store starts an individual thread (or something really looks like a thread in ***NodeJS***). When a middleware captures an action and handles its side effect, it can dispatch a new action to another middleware to do nested logics. This behavior of middleware indicates that thunks can be chained as well, for example thunkA forwards its return payload to thunkB and thunkB forwards its return payload to... **Wait! That sounds quite familiar!! Is that the case of callback hell??** Unfortunately, a good thing plus another good feature doesn't always end up with something better. ~~It could be some shit as well (笑)~~ In this case, true, this is exactly the callback hell.\n</br>\n\n## Redux Saga\nTo handle the possible endless callback functions and also to make it more easily to test in a component which has complicated logics, we need to change our previous thoughts. Just like shifting from Process Oriented Programming to Object Oriented Programming, instead of telling the application how to handle the side effects, suppose it already knows how to call a function and how to dispatch an action, all we need to do is to **give instructions about what to do next** and we don't care about how those instructions will be executed (Saga handles the executions).\n\nThen the thunks example can be changed as following:\n```javascript\nexport function* apiSideEffect(action) {\n    try{\n        const data = yield call(actualCallApi);\n        yield put({ type:\"SUCCESS\", payload: data });\n    } catch(err) {\n        yield put({ type:\"FAILED\", payload: err });\n    }\n}\n\nexport function* apiSaga() {\n    yield takeEvery(\"CLICK_TO_CALL_API\", apiSideEffect);\n}\n```\nThere are serval fucntions already being integrated in Saga:\n>**`Call`**: the method call will return only a plain object describing the operation so redux-saga can take care of the invocation and returns the result to the generator. The first parameter is the generator function ready to be called and the rest params are all the arguments in the generator.\n\n>**`Put`**: Instead of dispatching an action inside the generator (Don't ever ever do that), ***put*** Returns an object with instructions for the middleware to dispatch the action.\n\n>**`Select`**: Returns value from the selector function, similar with **`getState()`**. ***Note:*** It is not recommended to use this function because it returns the value corresponding to the contents of the store state tree, which is most likely a plain Javascript object and is **mutable** (Redux wants you to handle state immutably, which means return a new state instead of changing the old one).\n\n>**`Take`**: It creates a command object that tells the middleware to wait for a specific action. The resulting behavior of the call Effect is the same as when the middleware suspends the generator until a ***promise*** resolves. In the take case, it'll suspend the generator until a matching action is dispatched\n\nBy working with Saga, we make the side effects to be ***declarative*** rather than ***imperative***.\n>***Declarative:*** describing what the program must accomplish, rather than describe how to accomplish it\n\n>***Imperative:*** consists of commands for the computer to perform, focuses on describing how a program operates\n\nIn the case of take, the control is inverted. Instead of the actions being pushed to the handler tasks, the **Saga is pulling the action by itself**. An additional generator, known as ***watcher*** which contains ***take*** has to be created to watch a specific action and being triggered once the following action is dispatched in the application. There are two ways to create a watcher, one is using the buid-in functions (***Saga Helper***):\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeEvery(\"FETCH_REQUEST\", callFetchDataApi);\n}\n```\n***takeEvery*** allows multiple request to be proceeding at the same time. Or if you just want the latest request to be fired (the older one will be overrided during each time the watcher is triggered\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeLatest(\"FETCH_REQUEST\", callFetchDataApi);\n}\n```\nHowever by using ***take***, it is possible to fully control an action observation process to build complex control flow:\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    while(true) {\n        const action = yield take(\"FETCH_REQUEST\");\n        console.log(action);\n        yield call(callFetchDataApi, action.payload);\n    }\n}\n```\nAll right, now you have been exposed to everything you need to know before start trying redux saga on your own. Here is a short overall example that may also help:\nStore:\n```javascript\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();\nconst store = createStore(rootReducer, appluMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));    \nsagaMiddleware.run(watchFetch);\n```\nSagas:\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetch(): Generator<*, *, *> {\n    yield takeEvery(\"FETCH_ACTION\", callFetchAPI);\n}\n\nfunction* callFetchAPI(): Generator<*, *, *> {\n    try {\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCHING\", payload: ... });\n        const data = yield call(actualCallApi);\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCH_SUCCESS\", payload: data });\n    } catch(err) {\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCH_FAILED\", payload: err });\n    }\n}\n```\nReducer:\n```javascript\nconst reducer = (state = initState, action) => {\n    switch(action) {\n        case \"FETCHING\":\n            return { loading: true, ...state };\n        case \"FETCH_SUCCESS\":\n            return { loading: false, success: true, data: action.payload, ...state };   \n        case \"FETCH_FAILED\":\n            return { loading: false, success: false, error: true, ...state };\n        default:\n            return { ...state };\n    }\n};\n```\nComponent:\n```javascript\nclass myComponent extends React.Component {\n    const mapStateToProps = ...\n    const mapDispatchToProps = ...\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <button onClick = { () => this.props.dispatch({type: \"FETCH_ACTION\"}) }/>   \n            {\n                this.props.loading?\n                    <p>Loading..</p> : this.props.error?\n                        <p>Error!</p> : <p>{this.props.data}</p>\n            }\n        );\n    }\n}\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(myComponent);\n\n```\nFor more advanced concepts, there is a well-organized [Saga offical documentation](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/advanced/) you can refer to if you want to dive deeper.\n</br>\n\n## How to test Saga?\nA function that returns a simple object is easier to test than a function that directly makes an asynchronous call. For redux saga, each time you yield a function call will return a plain javascript object which makes the workflow much easier to test. You don’t need to use the real API, fake it, or mock it, instead just iterating over the generator function, asserting for equality on the values yielded.\n```javascript\ndescribe(\"fetch work flow\", () => {\n    const generator = cloneableGenerator(callFetchAPI)({ type: \"FETCH_ACTION\" });\n    expect(generator.next().value).toEqual(put({ type: \"FETCHING\", payload: ... }));    \n\n    test(\"fetch success\", () => {\n        const clone = generator.clone();\n        expect(clone.next().value).toEqual(put({ type: \"FETCH_SUCCESS\" }));\n        expect(generator.next().done).toEqual(true);\n    });\n});\n```\nIn the above example, we use **`clone()`** to test different control flows and **`next()`** to iterate to the next function ready be yielded. The mock return value can also be injected as an argument of **`next()`**:\n```javascript\nexpect(clone.next(false).value).toEqual( put(fetchFailedAction()) );      \n```\n</br>\n\n## Saga vs Observables\nRedux saga is not the only solution to our apps which may have complex control flows, they are other helpful tools providing different trade-offs which can also resolve the async problems. Here are some good [code snippets](https://hackmd.io/s/H1xLHUQ8e) of saga vs observables that can open your mind :D\n\n</br>\n</br>\n## References:\nhttps://redux-saga.js.org/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25098066/what-is-callback-hell-and-how-and-why-rx-solves-it\nhttps://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware\nhttps://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_thunk\nhttps://codeburst.io/how-i-test-redux-saga-fcc425cda018\nhttps://engineering.universe.com/what-is-redux-saga-c1252fc2f4d1\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/redux-without-react-state-management-vanilla-javascript/\nhttps://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started\nhttps://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-redux-saga-from-action-creators-to-sagas-2587298b5e71\n","source":"_posts/A-Brief-Introduce-to-Redux-Saga.md","raw":"---\ntitle: A Brief Introduce to Redux Saga\ndate: 2019-04-28 14:35:50\ntags: [Redux, Saga, React]\nphotos: [\"../images/redux-saga.JPG\"]\n---\nIf you are quite experienced with redux, which is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications (**Note:** even thouth React and Redux is a popular combination to build fast and powerful apps, Redux is not necessarily combined with React), you are definitely feeling comfortable with its powerful store which manages all the global states and provides much cleaner logic flows to change them.

That is always achieved by dispatching an action from the component to the reducer:\n```javascript\nasync const callAPI = () => {\n    ...\n    return response;\n};\n...\nasync const updateUI = (...params) => {\n    const res = await callAPI();\n    if (res.status === 200)\n        dispatch({type: \"UPDATE\", isSuccess: true});\n};\n...\nrender({\n    ...\n    this.props.isSuccess?\n        showData() : showError()\n});\n```\nThis isn't bad, but we are always looking for something better. An advanced way to rewrite it is using redux middleware. ***Middleware*** is somewhere you can put the code after the framework receives a request and before it generates a response. For example, we want to add a logger in the redux store so that when the store catches an action, before it returns the new state, the logger can log the previous state and the new generated state. This is what can be added as a middleware:\n```javascript\nfunction logger(store) {\n    return function wrapDispatch (next) {\n        return function dispatchAndLog (action) {\n            console.log(\"dispatching.. \", action);\n            let result = next(action);\n            console.log(\"new state\", store.getState());\n            return result;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThere are more advanced ways to add a logger. If you are interested, please refer to the [offical documentation](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware). With our middleware, the previous example can be written in a cleaner way:\n```javascript\nconst callAPI = () => {\n    return((dispatch) => {\n        dispatch(startCallingApiAction);\n        actualCallApi().then(data => {\n            dispatch(successAction(data));\n        }).fail(err => {\n            dispatch(failedAction(err));\n        });\n    });\n};\n```\nThe successful response data is wrapped in the payload of the action, sent to the reducer. Once the store updates the data, it will be mapped as a prop back to the component and request for a rerender. This middleware is also called ***thunk***. By applying thunk to decouple the presentation layer, we can get rid of most of the side effects in components, instead, managing and orchestrating side effects in thunks.\n\nThis is great, so why are we even considering ***saga***? Well, one of the advantages of middleware is that it can be chained. Every middleware mounted in redux store starts an individual thread (or something really looks like a thread in ***NodeJS***). When a middleware captures an action and handles its side effect, it can dispatch a new action to another middleware to do nested logics. This behavior of middleware indicates that thunks can be chained as well, for example thunkA forwards its return payload to thunkB and thunkB forwards its return payload to... **Wait! That sounds quite familiar!! Is that the case of callback hell??** Unfortunately, a good thing plus another good feature doesn't always end up with something better. ~~It could be some shit as well (笑)~~ In this case, true, this is exactly the callback hell.\n</br>\n\n## Redux Saga\nTo handle the possible endless callback functions and also to make it more easily to test in a component which has complicated logics, we need to change our previous thoughts. Just like shifting from Process Oriented Programming to Object Oriented Programming, instead of telling the application how to handle the side effects, suppose it already knows how to call a function and how to dispatch an action, all we need to do is to **give instructions about what to do next** and we don't care about how those instructions will be executed (Saga handles the executions).\n\nThen the thunks example can be changed as following:\n```javascript\nexport function* apiSideEffect(action) {\n    try{\n        const data = yield call(actualCallApi);\n        yield put({ type:\"SUCCESS\", payload: data });\n    } catch(err) {\n        yield put({ type:\"FAILED\", payload: err });\n    }\n}\n\nexport function* apiSaga() {\n    yield takeEvery(\"CLICK_TO_CALL_API\", apiSideEffect);\n}\n```\nThere are serval fucntions already being integrated in Saga:\n>**`Call`**: the method call will return only a plain object describing the operation so redux-saga can take care of the invocation and returns the result to the generator. The first parameter is the generator function ready to be called and the rest params are all the arguments in the generator.\n\n>**`Put`**: Instead of dispatching an action inside the generator (Don't ever ever do that), ***put*** Returns an object with instructions for the middleware to dispatch the action.\n\n>**`Select`**: Returns value from the selector function, similar with **`getState()`**. ***Note:*** It is not recommended to use this function because it returns the value corresponding to the contents of the store state tree, which is most likely a plain Javascript object and is **mutable** (Redux wants you to handle state immutably, which means return a new state instead of changing the old one).\n\n>**`Take`**: It creates a command object that tells the middleware to wait for a specific action. The resulting behavior of the call Effect is the same as when the middleware suspends the generator until a ***promise*** resolves. In the take case, it'll suspend the generator until a matching action is dispatched\n\nBy working with Saga, we make the side effects to be ***declarative*** rather than ***imperative***.\n>***Declarative:*** describing what the program must accomplish, rather than describe how to accomplish it\n\n>***Imperative:*** consists of commands for the computer to perform, focuses on describing how a program operates\n\nIn the case of take, the control is inverted. Instead of the actions being pushed to the handler tasks, the **Saga is pulling the action by itself**. An additional generator, known as ***watcher*** which contains ***take*** has to be created to watch a specific action and being triggered once the following action is dispatched in the application. There are two ways to create a watcher, one is using the buid-in functions (***Saga Helper***):\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeEvery(\"FETCH_REQUEST\", callFetchDataApi);\n}\n```\n***takeEvery*** allows multiple request to be proceeding at the same time. Or if you just want the latest request to be fired (the older one will be overrided during each time the watcher is triggered\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeLatest(\"FETCH_REQUEST\", callFetchDataApi);\n}\n```\nHowever by using ***take***, it is possible to fully control an action observation process to build complex control flow:\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n    while(true) {\n        const action = yield take(\"FETCH_REQUEST\");\n        console.log(action);\n        yield call(callFetchDataApi, action.payload);\n    }\n}\n```\nAll right, now you have been exposed to everything you need to know before start trying redux saga on your own. Here is a short overall example that may also help:\nStore:\n```javascript\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();\nconst store = createStore(rootReducer, appluMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));    \nsagaMiddleware.run(watchFetch);\n```\nSagas:\n```javascript\nfunction* watchFetch(): Generator<*, *, *> {\n    yield takeEvery(\"FETCH_ACTION\", callFetchAPI);\n}\n\nfunction* callFetchAPI(): Generator<*, *, *> {\n    try {\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCHING\", payload: ... });\n        const data = yield call(actualCallApi);\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCH_SUCCESS\", payload: data });\n    } catch(err) {\n        yield put({ type: \"FETCH_FAILED\", payload: err });\n    }\n}\n```\nReducer:\n```javascript\nconst reducer = (state = initState, action) => {\n    switch(action) {\n        case \"FETCHING\":\n            return { loading: true, ...state };\n        case \"FETCH_SUCCESS\":\n            return { loading: false, success: true, data: action.payload, ...state };   \n        case \"FETCH_FAILED\":\n            return { loading: false, success: false, error: true, ...state };\n        default:\n            return { ...state };\n    }\n};\n```\nComponent:\n```javascript\nclass myComponent extends React.Component {\n    const mapStateToProps = ...\n    const mapDispatchToProps = ...\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <button onClick = { () => this.props.dispatch({type: \"FETCH_ACTION\"}) }/>   \n            {\n                this.props.loading?\n                    <p>Loading..</p> : this.props.error?\n                        <p>Error!</p> : <p>{this.props.data}</p>\n            }\n        );\n    }\n}\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(myComponent);\n\n```\nFor more advanced concepts, there is a well-organized [Saga offical documentation](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/advanced/) you can refer to if you want to dive deeper.\n</br>\n\n## How to test Saga?\nA function that returns a simple object is easier to test than a function that directly makes an asynchronous call. For redux saga, each time you yield a function call will return a plain javascript object which makes the workflow much easier to test. You don’t need to use the real API, fake it, or mock it, instead just iterating over the generator function, asserting for equality on the values yielded.\n```javascript\ndescribe(\"fetch work flow\", () => {\n    const generator = cloneableGenerator(callFetchAPI)({ type: \"FETCH_ACTION\" });\n    expect(generator.next().value).toEqual(put({ type: \"FETCHING\", payload: ... }));    \n\n    test(\"fetch success\", () => {\n        const clone = generator.clone();\n        expect(clone.next().value).toEqual(put({ type: \"FETCH_SUCCESS\" }));\n        expect(generator.next().done).toEqual(true);\n    });\n});\n```\nIn the above example, we use **`clone()`** to test different control flows and **`next()`** to iterate to the next function ready be yielded. The mock return value can also be injected as an argument of **`next()`**:\n```javascript\nexpect(clone.next(false).value).toEqual( put(fetchFailedAction()) );      \n```\n</br>\n\n## Saga vs Observables\nRedux saga is not the only solution to our apps which may have complex control flows, they are other helpful tools providing different trade-offs which can also resolve the async problems. Here are some good [code snippets](https://hackmd.io/s/H1xLHUQ8e) of saga vs observables that can open your mind :D\n\n</br>\n</br>\n## References:\nhttps://redux-saga.js.org/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25098066/what-is-callback-hell-and-how-and-why-rx-solves-it\nhttps://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware\nhttps://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_thunk\nhttps://codeburst.io/how-i-test-redux-saga-fcc425cda018\nhttps://engineering.universe.com/what-is-redux-saga-c1252fc2f4d1\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/redux-without-react-state-management-vanilla-javascript/\nhttps://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started\nhttps://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-redux-saga-from-action-creators-to-sagas-2587298b5e71\n","slug":"A-Brief-Introduce-to-Redux-Saga","published":1,"updated":"2019-07-31T08:54:49.505Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","link":"","_id":"ck1qao38e00060kyl3itaqsgz","content":"<p>If you are quite experienced with redux, which is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications (<strong>Note:</strong> even thouth React and Redux is a popular combination to build fast and powerful apps, Redux is not necessarily combined with React), you are definitely feeling comfortable with its powerful store which manages all the global states and provides much cleaner logic flows to change them.

If you are new to redux, <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> is the guide to dive before we start our topic.</p>","more":"<p></p>\n<p>In a complex javascript application, asynchronous function is always one of the most annoying part where encounters tons of bugs. If not handle them properly, the app usually ends up with <strong><em>call back hell</em></strong>.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Haven’t-heard-of-CallBack-Hell\"><a href=\"#Haven’t-heard-of-CallBack-Hell\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Haven’t heard of CallBack Hell?\"></a><strong>Haven’t heard of <em>CallBack Hell</em>?</strong></h2><p>Well, in javascript, the only way you can suspend a computation and have the rest operations doing later is to put the rest operations into a callback function. This callback function usually returns a <strong><code>Promise</code></strong> (And has a type of <strong><code>Promise&lt;any&gt;</code></strong>). In order to easily mark those async functions, after <strong><em>ES6</em></strong> javascript provides extra modifiers <strong><code>async</code></strong> and <strong><code>await</code></strong>, which actually wraps up the original utilities of promise and makes it more readable to programmers. Hummm, sounds like things are going better… <del><strong>NO!! It doesn’t resolve anything!</strong></del> The core problem leads to a callback hell is the hierarchical async calls, for example</p>\n<p>you have some simple synchronous functions which are in a chain to accomplish some logics:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">a = getSomething();\nb = getMore(a);\nc = getMoreAndMore(b);\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>It looks fine for now, but what if they all turn out to be async? Then you have to follow the callback style to make them operate one right after another is done:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">getSomthing(function(a) {\n    getMore(a, function(b) {\n        getMoreAndMore(b, function(c) {\n            //keep going...\n        });\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you prefer <strong><em>ES6</em></strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">async function getSomething(a) {\n    await b = ToDo(a);\n    return await getMore((b) =&gt; {\n        return await ToDo(b);\n    }).then((c) =&gt; {\n        return await ToDo(c);\n    }).then(...);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looks really confused? This will getting even uglier if we are using callbacks in loops.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Redux-Thunks\"><a href=\"#Redux-Thunks\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Redux Thunks\"></a>Redux Thunks</h2><p>Back to our redux app, we usually want to update some states after an async call to inform the UI that the data is ready to be fetched. That is always achieved by dispatching an action from the component to the reducer:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">async const callAPI = () =&gt; {\n    ...\n    return response;\n};\n...\nasync const updateUI = (...params) =&gt; {\n    const res = await callAPI();\n    if (res.status === 200)\n        dispatch({type: &quot;UPDATE&quot;, isSuccess: true});\n};\n...\nrender({\n    ...\n    this.props.isSuccess?\n        showData() : showError()\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn’t bad, but we are always looking for something better. An advanced way to rewrite it is using redux middleware. <strong><em>Middleware</em></strong> is somewhere you can put the code after the framework receives a request and before it generates a response. For example, we want to add a logger in the redux store so that when the store catches an action, before it returns the new state, the logger can log the previous state and the new generated state. This is what can be added as a middleware:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">function logger(store) {\n    return function wrapDispatch (next) {\n        return function dispatchAndLog (action) {\n            console.log(&quot;dispatching.. &quot;, action);\n            let result = next(action);\n            console.log(&quot;new state&quot;, store.getState());\n            return result;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are more advanced ways to add a logger. If you are interested, please refer to the <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offical documentation</a>. With our middleware, the previous example can be written in a cleaner way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">const callAPI = () =&gt; {\n    return((dispatch) =&gt; {\n        dispatch(startCallingApiAction);\n        actualCallApi().then(data =&gt; {\n            dispatch(successAction(data));\n        }).fail(err =&gt; {\n            dispatch(failedAction(err));\n        });\n    });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The successful response data is wrapped in the payload of the action, sent to the reducer. Once the store updates the data, it will be mapped as a prop back to the component and request for a rerender. This middleware is also called <strong><em>thunk</em></strong>. By applying thunk to decouple the presentation layer, we can get rid of most of the side effects in components, instead, managing and orchestrating side effects in thunks.</p>\n<p>This is great, so why are we even considering <strong><em>saga</em></strong>? Well, one of the advantages of middleware is that it can be chained. Every middleware mounted in redux store starts an individual thread (or something really looks like a thread in <strong><em>NodeJS</em></strong>). When a middleware captures an action and handles its side effect, it can dispatch a new action to another middleware to do nested logics. This behavior of middleware indicates that thunks can be chained as well, for example thunkA forwards its return payload to thunkB and thunkB forwards its return payload to… <strong>Wait! That sounds quite familiar!! Is that the case of callback hell??</strong> Unfortunately, a good thing plus another good feature doesn’t always end up with something better. <del>It could be some shit as well (笑)</del> In this case, true, this is exactly the callback hell.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Redux-Saga\"><a href=\"#Redux-Saga\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Redux Saga\"></a>Redux Saga</h2><p>To handle the possible endless callback functions and also to make it more easily to test in a component which has complicated logics, we need to change our previous thoughts. Just like shifting from Process Oriented Programming to Object Oriented Programming, instead of telling the application how to handle the side effects, suppose it already knows how to call a function and how to dispatch an action, all we need to do is to <strong>give instructions about what to do next</strong> and we don’t care about how those instructions will be executed (Saga handles the executions).</p>\n<p>Then the thunks example can be changed as following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">export function* apiSideEffect(action) {\n    try{\n        const data = yield call(actualCallApi);\n        yield put({ type:&quot;SUCCESS&quot;, payload: data });\n    } catch(err) {\n        yield put({ type:&quot;FAILED&quot;, payload: err });\n    }\n}\n\nexport function* apiSaga() {\n    yield takeEvery(&quot;CLICK_TO_CALL_API&quot;, apiSideEffect);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are serval fucntions already being integrated in Saga:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>Call</code></strong>: the method call will return only a plain object describing the operation so redux-saga can take care of the invocation and returns the result to the generator. The first parameter is the generator function ready to be called and the rest params are all the arguments in the generator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>Put</code></strong>: Instead of dispatching an action inside the generator (Don’t ever ever do that), <strong><em>put</em></strong> Returns an object with instructions for the middleware to dispatch the action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>Select</code></strong>: Returns value from the selector function, similar with <strong><code>getState()</code></strong>. <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> It is not recommended to use this function because it returns the value corresponding to the contents of the store state tree, which is most likely a plain Javascript object and is <strong>mutable</strong> (Redux wants you to handle state immutably, which means return a new state instead of changing the old one).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>Take</code></strong>: It creates a command object that tells the middleware to wait for a specific action. The resulting behavior of the call Effect is the same as when the middleware suspends the generator until a <strong><em>promise</em></strong> resolves. In the take case, it’ll suspend the generator until a matching action is dispatched</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By working with Saga, we make the side effects to be <strong><em>declarative</em></strong> rather than <strong><em>imperative</em></strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Declarative:</em></strong> describing what the program must accomplish, rather than describe how to accomplish it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Imperative:</em></strong> consists of commands for the computer to perform, focuses on describing how a program operates</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the case of take, the control is inverted. Instead of the actions being pushed to the handler tasks, the <strong>Saga is pulling the action by itself</strong>. An additional generator, known as <strong><em>watcher</em></strong> which contains <strong><em>take</em></strong> has to be created to watch a specific action and being triggered once the following action is dispatched in the application. There are two ways to create a watcher, one is using the buid-in functions (<strong><em>Saga Helper</em></strong>):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">function* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeEvery(&quot;FETCH_REQUEST&quot;, callFetchDataApi);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong><em>takeEvery</em></strong> allows multiple request to be proceeding at the same time. Or if you just want the latest request to be fired (the older one will be overrided during each time the watcher is triggered</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">function* watchFetchData() {\n    yield takeLatest(&quot;FETCH_REQUEST&quot;, callFetchDataApi);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However by using <strong><em>take</em></strong>, it is possible to fully control an action observation process to build complex control flow:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">function* watchFetchData() {\n    while(true) {\n        const action = yield take(&quot;FETCH_REQUEST&quot;);\n        console.log(action);\n        yield call(callFetchDataApi, action.payload);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All right, now you have been exposed to everything you need to know before start trying redux saga on your own.

Base on different environment and servers, the strategy may vary. For here, I am working with **Kafka** and Google Cloud **PubSub**. <!-- more -->\n\n## Background\nI have such workflow that the spark streaming receives dataset from both Kafka and PubSub, after doing some clean up and modeling, push the data to the Cloud Datastore.\n![my Workflow](sparkworkflow.JPG)\nIt works fine when the data stream is small and reports me the expected values; however while the number of end users is growing large, especially when the data stream turns to be erratic and sometimes considerably large if end users interact frequently with our UI pages, the spark streaming will get a lot of uncertain runtime errors. Those errors are most likely caused by the finite number of workers in our cluster. Also when there are too much stream rushing over to the server, the limited memory in cache will cause failures. After we upgraded the cluster on cloud, the number of errors is significantly reduced.\n![CPU Utilization](cpudiagram.JPG)\nBut the data processed during the errors was permanently lost and cannot be recovered. The data running on spark is buffered in memory (cache) and will be cleared meanwhile a failure occurs. This is not desired since some valuable KPIs may be lost as well. To prevent such data loss, I tried different strategies.\n</br>\n\n## Checkpoint\nCheckpointing is a process supported by spark streaming after version which will save RDDs in log after being checkpointed. There are two level of checkpoints: reliable and local. **Reliable checkpoint** ensures that the data is stored permanentlly on HDFS, S3 or other distributed filesystems. Each job on cluster will create a directory for saving checkpointed logs, which will look pretty much like the directory below:\n```\n├── \"SomeUUID\"\n│   └── rdd-#\n│       ├── part-timestamp1\n│       ├── .part-timestamp1.crc\n│       ├── part-timestamp2\n│       └── .part-timestamp2.crc\n```\nSince the data stream will be replicated on disk, the performance will slow down due to file I/O. **Local checkpoint** privileges performance over fault-tolerance which will persist RDDs on local storage in the executors. Read or write will be faster in this case; however if a driver fails, the data not yet executed may not be recoverable. As default, the data storeage level is set to `MEMORY_AND_DISK` which saves data in cache and disk (some in cache and some in disk). For here I changed to `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2` (more details can be referred to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30520428/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-only-and-memory-and-disk-caching-level-in)). The different is that, unlike **cache** only, the checkpoints doesn't save DAG with all the parents of RDDs; instead, they only save particular RDDs and remain for a longer time than cache. The time of persistance is strictly related to the executed computation and ends with the end of the spark application. To apply the checkpoint machanism, you just simply need to set the checkpoint directory when you are creating the **StreamingContext**\n```scala\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")   \n     val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n     ...\n     ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n     ssc\n}\n```\nand before an action is operated on RDD:\n```scala\n    sRDD.checkpoint()\n    sRDD.foreachPartition { partitionOfRecords => {     \n        ...\n        }\n    }\n```\nand `sRDD.isCheckpointed()` will return **true**. For cleaning, the RDDs stored in cache will be cleaned with all other memory after the whole spark application is finished or terminated; the reliable RDDs stored on disk can be cleaned manually or set \n`spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints` property to be **true** to enable automatic cleaning. This driver recovery mechanism is sufficient to ensure zero data loss if all data was reliably store in the system. However for my circumstance, the data is read from **kafka** and some of the data buffered in memory could be lost. If the driver process fails, all the executors running will be killed as well, along with any data in their memory. This pushes me to look for other mechanisms which are more advanced.\n</br>\n\n## Write Ahead Logs\nWrite Ahead Logs are used in database and file systems to ensure the durability of any data operations. The intention of the operation is first written down into a durable log , and then the operation is applied to the data. If the system fails in the middle of applying the operation, it can recover by reading the log and reapplying the operations it had intended to do.\n\nSpark streaming uses **Receiver** to read data from **Kafka**. They run as long-running tasks in the executors and store the revecived data in the memory of the executors. If you enable the **checkpoint**, the data will be checkpointed either in cache or disk **in executors** before porceed into the application drivers. Unlike **checkpoint**, applying **WAL** will instead backup the recevied data in an **external fault-tolerant filesystem**. And after the executor batches the received data and sends to the driver, **WAL** supports another log to store the block metadata into external filesystem before being executed.\n![https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/15/improved-driver-fault-tolerance-and-zero-data-loss-in-spark-streaming.html](wal_spark.JPG)\n(diagram from https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/15/improved-driver-fault-tolerance-and-zero-data-loss-in-spark-streaming.html)\nSpark streaming starts supporting WAL after version 1.2 and can be enabled by setting the config:\n\n```scala\nval ssc = StreamingContext.createContext(...params)\n\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable\",\"true\")    \n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n    ...\n    ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n    ssc\n}\n```\nSet the spark automatically clean checkpoints to release disk memory:\n```scala\nval ssc = StreamingContext.createContext(...params)\n\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable\",\"true\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints\", \"true\")    \n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n    ...\n    ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n    ssc\n}\n\n```\nThis will not clean the latest checkpoint as it is still referred to by the application to recover from possible failures. If you expect to restart the application driver if it crashed due to some errors and exactly start from where it crashed last time instead of performing the whole operation once again, you can create **StreamingContext** from the previous checkpoint by using the method `getOrCreate()`:\n```scala\nval ssc = StreamingContext.getOrCreate(CHECK_POINT_DIR, () => createContext(...params))\n\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable\",\"true\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints\", \"true\")    \n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n    ...\n    ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n    ssc\n}\n```\nHowever after I tried switching to `getOrCreate()`, I had the following exception:\n```\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Failed to read checkpoint from directory checkpointDir\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointReader$.read(Checkpoint.scala:368)\n\tat org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext$.getOrCreate(StreamingContext.scala:827)\n    ...\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: java.lang.ClassCastException: cannot assign instance of com.some.project$$anonfun$1 to field org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.MappedDStream.org$apache$spark$streaming$dstream$MappedDStream$$mapFunc of type scala.Function1 in instance of org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.MappedDStream     \n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryOrIOException(Utils.scala:1310)\n\tat org.apache.spark.streaming.DStreamGraph.readObject(DStreamGraph.scala:194)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    ...\n```\nIt is because this is not the first time I use checkpoints, and there already exsists some other checkpoints in the same root directory (etc, the simple checkpoint discussed previously). Since the application tried to read from those unrelated checkpoints and expected to cast them to generate new context, it would throw such **ClassCastException**. This can be easily solved by deleting original checkpoints in HDFS locals (manually).\n\nWAL is an advanced checkpoint mechanism and also simple to be applied. Compared with checkpoint, it saves data into an external filesystem so that even though if the executor is terminated and the data in memory is clean-uped, data still can be recovered from the external filesystem. However. it can only recover the data which is logged in the filesystem, if the drivers fail due to some error, the executor will be terminated as well, so as the WAL writer. Then the rest incomming data will not be logged into the filesystem and hence, is not recoverable. It can be tested by calling **stop** to the **StreamContext**:\n```scala\ndef stop(stopSparkContext: Boolean, stopGracefully: Boolean): Unit\n```\nOnce it is called, the following console log interpretes that the **WAL Writer** is interrupted as well:\n```\nERROR ReceiverTracker: Deregistered receiver for stream 0: Stopped by driver\nWARN BlockGenerator: Cannot stop BlockGenerator as its not in the Active state [state = StoppedAll]     \nWARN BatchedWriteAheadLog: BatchedWriteAheadLog Writer queue interrupted.\n```\nAnd also the data will not be recoverable across applications or Spark upgrades and hence not very reliable\n</br>\n\n## Kafka Direct API\nThis mechanism is only available when you data source is **Kafka**. Kafka supports a commit strategy which is able to help you manage offsets of each topics. Each offset points to a slot in a topic. When the data stored in this slot is consumed by any receiver, Kafka will be acknowledged by this consumption and moves the index to the next data slot.\n![https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2017/06/offset-management-for-apache-kafka-with-apache-spark-streaming/](Spark-Streaming-flow-for-offsets.JPG)\n(diagram from https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2017/06/offset-management-for-apache-kafka-with-apache-spark-streaming/)\nWhen `enable.auto.commit` is set to be true, as soon as any receiver retrieves the data from the offset datastore in Kafka (here I use Kafka to store offsets), the receiver will automatically commit, which doesn't ensure that the data is successfully executed in the spark streaming. Therefore, we have to disbale the auto-commit when we are creating DStream from Kafka. After the data is successfully processed, we manually commit the offset to the datastore by calling the Kafka direct API:\n```scala\nstream.foreachRDD { rdd =>\n      //get current offset\n      val offsetRanges = rdd.asInstanceOf[HasOffsetRanges].offsetRanges\n\n      //process data\n\n      //store data in some datastore\n      DataStoreDB.push(...param)\n\n      //commit offset to kafka\n      stream.asInstanceOf[CanCommitOffsets].commitAsync(offsetRanges)\n    }\n  }\n```\nIf an error occurs at any point during the execution, the offset won;t be committed to the kafka offset store and hence the same data will be resent by kafka, which ensures that the data will be executed only once.\n","source":"_posts/Implement-Zero-Data-Loss-in-Spark-Streaming.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Implement Zero Data Loss in Spark Streaming\ndate: 2019-05-22 18:19:14\ntags: [Spark, Kafka]\nphotos: [\"../images/spark_kafka.JPG\"]\n---\nThis is a log from my own experience in spark streaming during my work. Base on different environment and servers, the strategy may vary. For here, I am working with **Kafka** and Google Cloud **PubSub**. <!-- more -->\n\n## Background\nI have such workflow that the spark streaming receives dataset from both Kafka and PubSub, after doing some clean up and modeling, push the data to the Cloud Datastore.\n![my Workflow](sparkworkflow.JPG)\nIt works fine when the data stream is small and reports me the expected values; however while the number of end users is growing large, especially when the data stream turns to be erratic and sometimes considerably large if end users interact frequently with our UI pages, the spark streaming will get a lot of uncertain runtime errors. Those errors are most likely caused by the finite number of workers in our cluster. Also when there are too much stream rushing over to the server, the limited memory in cache will cause failures. After we upgraded the cluster on cloud, the number of errors is significantly reduced.\n![CPU Utilization](cpudiagram.JPG)\nBut the data processed during the errors was permanently lost and cannot be recovered. The data running on spark is buffered in memory (cache) and will be cleared meanwhile a failure occurs. This is not desired since some valuable KPIs may be lost as well. To prevent such data loss, I tried different strategies.\n</br>\n\n## Checkpoint\nCheckpointing is a process supported by spark streaming after version which will save RDDs in log after being checkpointed. There are two level of checkpoints: reliable and local. **Reliable checkpoint** ensures that the data is stored permanentlly on HDFS, S3 or other distributed filesystems. Each job on cluster will create a directory for saving checkpointed logs, which will look pretty much like the directory below:\n```\n├── \"SomeUUID\"\n│   └── rdd-#\n│       ├── part-timestamp1\n│       ├── .part-timestamp1.crc\n│       ├── part-timestamp2\n│       └── .part-timestamp2.crc\n```\nSince the data stream will be replicated on disk, the performance will slow down due to file I/O. **Local checkpoint** privileges performance over fault-tolerance which will persist RDDs on local storage in the executors. Read or write will be faster in this case; however if a driver fails, the data not yet executed may not be recoverable. As default, the data storeage level is set to `MEMORY_AND_DISK` which saves data in cache and disk (some in cache and some in disk). For here I changed to `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2` (more details can be referred to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30520428/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-only-and-memory-and-disk-caching-level-in)). The different is that, unlike **cache** only, the checkpoints doesn't save DAG with all the parents of RDDs; instead, they only save particular RDDs and remain for a longer time than cache. The time of persistance is strictly related to the executed computation and ends with the end of the spark application. To apply the checkpoint machanism, you just simply need to set the checkpoint directory when you are creating the **StreamingContext**\n```scala\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")   \n     val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n     ...\n     ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n     ssc\n}\n```\nand before an action is operated on RDD:\n```scala\n    sRDD.checkpoint()\n    sRDD.foreachPartition { partitionOfRecords => {     \n        ...\n        }\n    }\n```\nand `sRDD.isCheckpointed()` will return **true**. For cleaning, the RDDs stored in cache will be cleaned with all other memory after the whole spark application is finished or terminated; the reliable RDDs stored on disk can be cleaned manually or set \n`spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints` property to be **true** to enable automatic cleaning. This driver recovery mechanism is sufficient to ensure zero data loss if all data was reliably store in the system. However for my circumstance, the data is read from **kafka** and some of the data buffered in memory could be lost. If the driver process fails, all the executors running will be killed as well, along with any data in their memory. This pushes me to look for other mechanisms which are more advanced.\n</br>\n\n## Write Ahead Logs\nWrite Ahead Logs are used in database and file systems to ensure the durability of any data operations. The intention of the operation is first written down into a durable log , and then the operation is applied to the data. If the system fails in the middle of applying the operation, it can recover by reading the log and reapplying the operations it had intended to do.\n\nSpark streaming uses **Receiver** to read data from **Kafka**. They run as long-running tasks in the executors and store the revecived data in the memory of the executors. If you enable the **checkpoint**, the data will be checkpointed either in cache or disk **in executors** before porceed into the application drivers. Unlike **checkpoint**, applying **WAL** will instead backup the recevied data in an **external fault-tolerant filesystem**. And after the executor batches the received data and sends to the driver, **WAL** supports another log to store the block metadata into external filesystem before being executed.\n![https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/15/improved-driver-fault-tolerance-and-zero-data-loss-in-spark-streaming.html](wal_spark.JPG)\n(diagram from https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/15/improved-driver-fault-tolerance-and-zero-data-loss-in-spark-streaming.html)\nSpark streaming starts supporting WAL after version 1.2 and can be enabled by setting the config:\n\n```scala\nval ssc = StreamingContext.createContext(...params)\n\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable\",\"true\")    \n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n    ...\n    ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n    ssc\n}\n```\nSet the spark automatically clean checkpoints to release disk memory:\n```scala\nval ssc = StreamingContext.createContext(...params)\n\ndef createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"KpiAnalysis\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable\",\"true\")\n                                   .set(\"spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints\", \"true\")    \n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n    ...\n    ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n    ssc\n}\n\n```\nThis will not clean the latest checkpoint as it is still referred to by the application to recover from possible failures.

Base on different environment and servers, the strategy may vary. For here, I am working with <strong>Kafka</strong> and Google Cloud <strong>PubSub</strong>.</p>","more":"<p></p>\n<h2 id=\"Background\"><a href=\"#Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Background\"></a>Background</h2><p>I have such workflow that the spark streaming receives dataset from both Kafka and PubSub, after doing some clean up and modeling, push the data to the Cloud Datastore.<br><img src=\"/2019/05/22/Implement-Zero-Data-Loss-in-Spark-Streaming/sparkworkflow.JPG\" alt=\"my Workflow\"><br>It works fine when the data stream is small and reports me the expected values; however while the number of end users is growing large, especially when the data stream turns to be erratic and sometimes considerably large if end users interact frequently with our UI pages, the spark streaming will get a lot of uncertain runtime errors. Those errors are most likely caused by the finite number of workers in our cluster. Also when there are too much stream rushing over to the server, the limited memory in cache will cause failures. After we upgraded the cluster on cloud, the number of errors is significantly reduced.<br><img src=\"/2019/05/22/Implement-Zero-Data-Loss-in-Spark-Streaming/cpudiagram.JPG\" alt=\"CPU Utilization\"><br>But the data processed during the errors was permanently lost and cannot be recovered. The data running on spark is buffered in memory (cache) and will be cleared meanwhile a failure occurs. This is not desired since some valuable KPIs may be lost as well. To prevent such data loss, I tried different strategies.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Checkpoint\"><a href=\"#Checkpoint\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Checkpoint\"></a>Checkpoint</h2><p>Checkpointing is a process supported by spark streaming after version which will save RDDs in log after being checkpointed. There are two level of checkpoints: reliable and local. <strong>Reliable checkpoint</strong> ensures that the data is stored permanentlly on HDFS, S3 or other distributed filesystems. Each job on cluster will create a directory for saving checkpointed logs, which will look pretty much like the directory below:</p>\n<pre><code>├── &quot;SomeUUID&quot;\n│   └── rdd-#\n│       ├── part-timestamp1\n│       ├── .part-timestamp1.crc\n│       ├── part-timestamp2\n│       └── .part-timestamp2.crc\n</code></pre><p>Since the data stream will be replicated on disk, the performance will slow down due to file I/O. <strong>Local checkpoint</strong> privileges performance over fault-tolerance which will persist RDDs on local storage in the executors. Read or write will be faster in this case; however if a driver fails, the data not yet executed may not be recoverable. As default, the data storeage level is set to <code>MEMORY_AND_DISK</code> which saves data in cache and disk (some in cache and some in disk). For here I changed to <code>MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2</code> (more details can be referred to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30520428/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-only-and-memory-and-disk-caching-level-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>). The different is that, unlike <strong>cache</strong> only, the checkpoints doesn’t save DAG with all the parents of RDDs; instead, they only save particular RDDs and remain for a longer time than cache. The time of persistance is strictly related to the executed computation and ends with the end of the spark application. To apply the checkpoint machanism, you just simply need to set the checkpoint directory when you are creating the <strong>StreamingContext</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"scala\">def createContext(...params): StreamingContext = {\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(&quot;KpiAnalysis&quot;)   \n     val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(1))\n     ...\n     ssc.checkpoint(CHECK_POINT_DIR)\n     ssc\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and before an action is operated on RDD:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"scala\">    sRDD.checkpoint()\n    sRDD.foreachPartition { partitionOfRecords =&gt; {     \n        ...\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <code>sRDD.isCheckpointed()</code> will return <strong>true</strong>. For cleaning, the RDDs stored in cache will be cleaned with all other memory after the whole spark application is finished or terminated; the reliable RDDs stored on disk can be cleaned manually or set<br><code>spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints</code> property to be <strong>true</strong> to enable automatic cleaning. This driver recovery mechanism is sufficient to ensure zero data loss if all data was reliably store in the system. However for my circumstance, the data is read from <strong>kafka</strong> and some of the data buffered in memory could be lost. If the driver process fails, all the executors running will be killed as well, along with any data in their memory. This pushes me to look for other mechanisms which are more advanced.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Write-Ahead-Logs\"><a href=\"#Write-Ahead-Logs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Write Ahead Logs\"></a>Write Ahead Logs</h2><p>Write Ahead Logs are used in database and file systems to ensure the durability of any data operations. The intention of the operation is first written down into a durable log , and then the operation is applied to the data. If the system fails in the middle of applying the operation, it can recover by reading the log and reapplying the operations it had intended to do.</p>\n<p>Spark streaming uses <strong>Receiver</strong> to read data from <strong>Kafka</strong>.

When an object is initialized, it will be dynamically allocated to a piece of memory in the heap and ready to be manipulated. After we perform some operations and the whole procedure is finished, the object stored in heap should also be erased; however in the case of memory leak, that piece of memory is not released but still held in the heap, marked as occupied but no reference refers to it.<!-- more -->\n\nWiki's Def:\n>[**Memory leak**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak) is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that: \n- memory which is no longer needed is not released\n- an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code\n\nWe usually encounter this issue in programming languages that don't have [**GC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science), for example C++ and C. For such languages, we have to manage the memory by ourselves which, if not done properly, will expose the risks of memory leaks.\n</br>\n\n## This is really common in C++\nLet's take a look in C++. There are literally hundreds of ways that can cause memory leaks and most of them won't be detected during compilation and even in runtime. Only a few leaks will not have any impact on the system; however if we are running a huge application and those leaks accumulate, that will significantly reduce the real runtime performance of the whole system.\n\nWe all know that when we allocate an object, we have to release the memory if this object is not used anymore. The way we release the memory is simply call the buid-in function **`free()`** or **`delete[]`**. However in C++ the procedure can exit anywhere. An exception can be thrown in the half way so that the code doesn't ever reach the line to release memory:\n```c++\nint sample(int n) {\n    void  *ptr = malloc(16);\n    if (n)\n        return -1; //memory leak here\n    free(ptr);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nor:\n```c++\nclass Sample {\n    public:\n        init() { int *n = new int;  throw any_exception(); }\n        ~init() { delete n; }\n    private:\n        int *n;\n};\nSample *n = new Sample; //memory leak here\n```\nThe solution to the above examples is also really simple: check control flows and **do remember to call the destructor before anywhere the procedure may exit**. Well if you want to do it in a fancy way, you can use ***smart pointer*** alternatively:\n```c++\nclass Sample {\n    public:\n        init() { n = std::make_shared<int>(new int) }\n        ~init() {}\n    private:\n        std::shared_ptr<int> n;\n};\n```\nSmart pointer helps you manage this object and if it is not referred anymore, release its memory.\n</br>\n\n## free( )/delete is not enough\nNow your program has such a concrete control flow that **free( )** or **delete** is called before all the possible drop out. That is great but still not enough. **free( )** and **delete** can **only release the memory where the pointer is currently pointing to but not the pointer itself!** The pointer will still point to the original memory address but the content has been already removed. In this circumstance, the value of the pointer does not equal to **NULL**, instead some random values that cannot be predicted.\n```c++\nint main() {\n    char *p = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * 100);\n    strcpy(p, \"hello\");\n    free(p);\n    if (p != NULL) //doesn't prevent issue\n        strcpy(p, \"world\"); // error\n}\n```\nThis pointer p is called [***dangling pointer***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer) or [***wild pointer***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer) and will only be erased after the whole procedure is finished or terminated. The wild pointer is really risky because of its random behavior. Imagine there is something in your room that sometimes can be observed sometimes cannot, randomly breaks your stuff but never leaves footprint. In programming it is called wild pointer, and in real life it is called [**cat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat). To prevent it, we should **always set the pointer to be NULL when it is not used/the memory is released**.\n\n***Note***: when you define a pointer without setting up its initial value, that pointer will also be a **wild pointer** and has a value of some random number (which doesn't equal to **NULL**). Hence it is necessary to set the value of a pointer to be **NULL** if it cannot be asigned a value at the beginning.\n\nFor some simple pointers, they can be reasigned to **NULL** to prevent **wild pointer**, however for a pointer referring to a hierarchical object, simply setting to **NULL** cannot resolve the potential issues. For example, you are using a **`vector`** in C++ :\n```c++\nvector <string> v\nint main() {\n    for (int i=0; i<1000000; i++)\n        v.push_back(\"test\");\n    \n    cout << v.capacity() << endl;  //memory usage: 54M\n    v.clear();\n    cout << v.capacity() << endl;  //memory usage: still 54M\n}\n```\nEven though we have cleared the vector and all its elements were indeed released, the capacity of the vector is still unchanged. **`clear()`** removed all its element but cannot shrink the size of the container. The same thing happens to other containers such as **`deque`**. To handle this, before **C++ 11**, we can swap the pointers:\n```c++\nint main() {\n    ...\n    v.clear();\n    vector<string>(v).swap(v); //new a vector with the same content and swap    \n    cout << v.capacity() << endl;  //memory usage: 0\n}\n```\nafter C++ 11, it provides function **`shrink_to_fit()`** to remove the extra allocated memory.\n</br>\n\n## GC doesn't avoid memory leaks\nIt's not suprising that GC can prevent most cases of memory leaks because it is runnig in an individual thread, checking the memory regularly and removing the unreferred objects. It is so powerful that porgrammers rarely pay attention to memory management and be aware of the memory leaks. **Java** is such language which has powerful and unruly GC that can be hardly controlled (call **`System.gc()`** doesn't certainly invoke GC). It helps to manage the memory in jvm, but it cannot avoid memory leaks.\n\nThere are mainly two cases that can lead to memory leaks in Java. One is the object which has a longer lifecycle keeps a reference to another object which has a shorter lifecycle:\n```java\npublic class Sample {\n    Object object;\n    public void anymethod(){\n        object = new Object();\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\nIf ***object*** is only used inside ***anymethod( )***, then after stack pops ***anymethod( )***, the lifecycle of ***object*** should also be ended. But for here, because class ***Sample*** is still proceeding and keeps the reference of ***object***, ***object*** cannot be collected by GC and hence leaks the memory. The solution will be either init ***object*** inside ***anymethod( )*** (as a local varible) or set ***object*** to be ***null*** after ***anymethod*** is finished.\n\nAnother case is the use of **`HashSet`**. ***HashSet*** is the implementation of hash-table and it stores elements according to their different hash values. In order to push and withdraw the same object in the ***HashSet***, we need to override the method **`HashCode()`** so that the same object has the same hash vaule and being stored in the same place in ***HashSet***. However, if we push something into the ***HashSet*** and then change some properties of this object (those properties are most likely to be used to calculate the hashcode), the hashcode of this object may vary and when we refer this object back to our ***HashSet*** to do some operations, for example delete this object from the ***HashSet***, this object might not be found in the set and hence cannot be deleted:\n```java\n    HashSet<Obejct> set = new HashSet<Object>();\n    Object something = new Object();\n    set.add(something);\n    something.doSomethingChanges();\n    set.contains(something);  //this may return false\n    set.remove(something);  //'something' cannot be removed if the previous line returns false      \n```\n</br>\n\n## Python\n\n","source":"_posts/Memory-Leak-in-Serveral-Commonly-Used-Programming-Languages.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Memory Leaks in Serveral Commonly Used Programming Languages\ndate: 2019-05-05 15:37:22\ntags: [C++, Java, Python, NodeJS]\nphotos: [\"../images/Memory-Leaks.JPG\"]\n---\nUsually when we talk about memory leaks we are actually talking about the memory leaks in heap memory.

For example, if the evalue of **x** is **2**, then the expression:\n```python\n( let (( x 3 )\n        ( y ( + x 2 )))\n    ( * x y ))\n```\nThe value of **y** will be **4** as being outside of the **let** body, and the output will be **3 * 4 = 12**.

On contrary, is there a preprocessing which can be applied on **text** to speed up the whole process? This is the key reason why I am moving to **suffix tree**, which is a data structure doing preprocessing on text.\n</br>\n\n## Suffix Tree\n\nMy previous post used to introduce a prefix tree, for example:\n![prefix tree sample](prefix_tree.JPG)\nIndividual nodes branch out from the same prefix. As you can see, there are some nodes which only have one child. Let's try to compress them together:\n![prefix tree sample](Compressed_PrefixTree.JPG)\nAfter the compression, we get a **Compressed Prefix Tree**. A compressed prefix tree, also called **Compressed Tire** is the fundamental of suffix tree. Besides, the key values stored in each nodes of a suffix tree is all the possible suffix.\n\nFor example, for a single word (**Text**) `banana\\0`, we have the following set of suffix:\n```\nbanana\\0\nanana\\0\nnana\\0\nana\\0\nna\\0\na\\0\n\\0\n```\nConstruct a prefix tree using the above key words:\n![Banana Prefix Tree](Banana_PrefixTree.JPG)\nAfterwards, compress it:\n![Banana Suffix Tree](Banana_SuffixTree.JPG)\nHere, by lising all the suffix and making a compressed prefix tree, we obtain a suffix tree.\n\nHowever, there is a faster way to construct a suffix tree which can be done in the linear time (By Esko Ukkonen in 1997). Let's start from a simple example before exploring more complicated cases.\n</br>\n\n## \"abc\"\nUnlike prefix tree, the edge in suffix tree will no longer represent a single character(key); instead, it will represent a list of integers [from, to] which interprets the indexes in the original text. Therefore, each edge can represent abitrary length of characters and consume constant memory.\n\nConsidering a simple string ` abc ` which has no duplicated character. Start from the first character ` a `, construct an edge from root node to its leaf:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- a](PrefixTree_a.JPG)\nWhere [0, #] represents start from offset 0 and end up at offset #. Currently # equals to 1, which represents character ` a `.\n\nAfter finishing the procudure of the first character, let's move forward to the second one ` b `:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- ab](PrefixTree_ab.JPG)\nThen do the same thing on the last character ` c `:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- abc](PrefixTree_abc.JPG)\nWe maintain a pointer pointing to the current end character of the text. Each time when we add a new edge for a new character, we will update the # point. Thus, the runtime for each procedure is O(1) and hence the overall runtime to construct this \"abc\" suffix tree will be O(n).\n</br>\n\n## \"abcabxabcd\"\n\"abc\" is a really simple example since there is no duplicated characters in the text. Now let's consider a more complicated text ` abcabxabcd `. Before we get started to construct, there are two more concepts that need to be introduced\n\n- **active point**: a structure indicates `active_node`, `active_value` and `offset`\n- **remainder**: remaining characters to be inserted\n\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n</br>\n\n### The first character => `a`\n\nWe append ` a ` directly to the root node\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1), states that we are going to insert a new node\n2. Append 'a' to the root node\n3. After the insertion, a new node is appended to the tree, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (1 - 1)\n4. After the whole procudure:\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-a.JPG)\n\n### The second character => `b`\n\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1), states that we are going to insert a new node\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'a' to 'ab'\n3. Query the current node, which is the root node, since there is no prefix starts with 'b', we need to create a new node and insert 'b'. (The prefix for the previous prefix will be [a, ab] now)\n3. After the insertion, a new node is appended to the tree, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (1 - 1)\n4. After the whole procudure:\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-ab.JPG)\n\n### The third character => `c`\n\nSame as the procedure of inserting 'b'\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-abc.JPG)\n\n### The fourth character => `a` again\n\nThis time we encounter the same character we have already inserted\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1)\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abc' -> 'abca', 'bc' -> 'bca', 'c' -> 'ca'\n3. Query the current node, which is the root node, find out the there already exist a prefix which starts from 'a'; hence we modify the `active_point`:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'a', 1)\nremainder = 1\n```\n> **active_node**: the parent node is still root node hence remain unchanged\n> **active_value**: the current value will be set to 'a'\n> **offset**: the offset of the current value, which is 1 (states the first character in the prefix)\n> **remainder** after the insertion, no new node is inserted in the tree, hence remainder keep the same (remainder = 1)\n\n\n### The fifth character => `b` again\n\nStill duplicated with previous nodes\n1. `remainder = remainder + 1` (1 + 1)\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abca' -> 'abcab', 'bca' -> 'bcab', 'ca' -> 'cab', `active_point[1] = 'a' -> 'ab'`\n3. Start from **active_node**, query the **active_value** in its prefix and the prefix of its sub-nodes. Modify **active_point** to the following:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'ab', 2)\nremainder = 2\n```\n> **active_node**: the active node is still root node hence remain unchanged.\n> **active_value**: the active value has been expended to 'ab'.\n> **offset**: 'ab' already exists in node 'ab' (which is the sub-node of root node), the offset of matched index is 2.\n> **remainder**: after the insertion, no new node is inserted in the tree, hence remainder keep the same\n\nBy this step, we still have the same amount of nodes inserted into the tree (3 nodes)\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcab](SuffixTree-Sample-abcab.JPG)\n\n### The sixth character => `x`\n\n1. `remainder = remainder + 1` (2 + 1).\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abcab' -> 'abcabx', 'bcab' -> 'bcabx', 'cab' -> 'cabx', `active_point[1] = 'ab' -> 'abx'`.\n3. Start from **active_node**, query the **active_value** in its prefix and the prefix of its sub-nodes. Since there isn't a prefix which perfectly matches the pattern 'abx'; hence this is the point where to **split**:\n\n### Split\n\nWhen we find out the exact place where the prefix starts to mismatch the pattern, then we need to insert new nodes to our tree to append this new suffix character. For example, prefix 'abc' and pattern 'abx' share the same two characters 'ab' at the beginning and mismatch at the third character (offset = 3), then we can simply split at the third index to make a tree like 'ab' -> ['c', 'x']. We will do the same thing here:\n1. We already know the offset (which is active_point[2]).\n2. Split node **'abcabx' to 'ab' -> ['cabx', 'x']**.\n3. Modify **active_point** and **remainder**:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'bx', 1)\nremainder = 2\n```\n> **active_node**: still root node\n> **active_value**: 'abx' has been inserted, then we need to insert 'bx', then 'x' and so on so far\n> **offset**: active_point[1] changes from 'abx' to 'bx', then the offset will also shift from 2 to 1\n> **remainder**: a new node is inserted, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (3 - 1)\n>> **Why do we change offset as well?**\n>> This is actually a trick to reduce runtime. For each step of insertion, we will make an sub suffix tree by characters we already have (inserted). For example, if we have a string 'abc' and we have inserted the last character 'c' in the suffix tree, then all possible suffix of string (text) 'abc', which is 'abc', 'bc' and 'c' must exist in the suffix tree, either implicitly (have not splitted yet, like the fourth insertion above) or explicitly (has its own node). Hence, by inserting 'ab +x' and splitting the node, we know that 'b +x' must exist in the tree; therefore, we reduce the offset by 1 to state that the offset of the next split will start from the first character of the node 'b...'.\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx.JPG)\n4. The remainder is still greater than 0; hence we will keep inserting 'bx'. Do the same thing here, start from the **parent_node**, query the sub prefix 'bx'. Found 'bx' in the prefix 'bcabx'; hence split the node **'bcabx' to 'b' -> ['cabx', 'x']**\n5. Modify **active_point** and **remainder**:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'x', 0)\nremainder = 1\n```\n> **active_node**: still root node\n> **active_value**: 'bx' has been inserted, then we need to insert 'x'\n> **offset**: active_point[1] changes from 'bx' to 'x', then the offset will also shift from 1 to 0\n> **remainder**: a new node is inserted, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (2 - 1)\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx - 2](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx-2.JPG)\n\n6. Since remainder is still greater than 0, we have to do another insertion to reduce it to zero.

On contrary, is there a preprocessing which can be applied on **text** to speed up the whole process? This is the key reason why I am moving to **suffix tree**, which is a data structure doing preprocessing on text.\n</br>\n\n## Suffix Tree\n\nMy previous post used to introduce a prefix tree, for example:\n![prefix tree sample](prefix_tree.JPG)\nIndividual nodes branch out from the same prefix. As you can see, there are some nodes which only have one child. Let's try to compress them together:\n![prefix tree sample](Compressed_PrefixTree.JPG)\nAfter the compression, we get a **Compressed Prefix Tree**. A compressed prefix tree, also called **Compressed Tire** is the fundamental of suffix tree. Besides, the key values stored in each nodes of a suffix tree is all the possible suffix.\n\nFor example, for a single word (**Text**) `banana\\0`, we have the following set of suffix:\n```\nbanana\\0\nanana\\0\nnana\\0\nana\\0\nna\\0\na\\0\n\\0\n```\nConstruct a prefix tree using the above key words:\n![Banana Prefix Tree](Banana_PrefixTree.JPG)\nAfterwards, compress it:\n![Banana Suffix Tree](Banana_SuffixTree.JPG)\nHere, by lising all the suffix and making a compressed prefix tree, we obtain a suffix tree.\n\nHowever, there is a faster way to construct a suffix tree which can be done in the linear time (By Esko Ukkonen in 1997). Let's start from a simple example before exploring more complicated cases.\n</br>\n\n## \"abc\"\nUnlike prefix tree, the edge in suffix tree will no longer represent a single character(key); instead, it will represent a list of integers [from, to] which interprets the indexes in the original text. Therefore, each edge can represent abitrary length of characters and consume constant memory.\n\nConsidering a simple string ` abc ` which has no duplicated character. Start from the first character ` a `, construct an edge from root node to its leaf:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- a](PrefixTree_a.JPG)\nWhere [0, #] represents start from offset 0 and end up at offset #. Currently # equals to 1, which represents character ` a `.\n\nAfter finishing the procudure of the first character, let's move forward to the second one ` b `:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- ab](PrefixTree_ab.JPG)\nThen do the same thing on the last character ` c `:\n![Sample \"abc\" -- abc](PrefixTree_abc.JPG)\nWe maintain a pointer pointing to the current end character of the text. Each time when we add a new edge for a new character, we will update the # point. Thus, the runtime for each procedure is O(1) and hence the overall runtime to construct this \"abc\" suffix tree will be O(n).\n</br>\n\n## \"abcabxabcd\"\n\"abc\" is a really simple example since there is no duplicated characters in the text. Now let's consider a more complicated text ` abcabxabcd `. Before we get started to construct, there are two more concepts that need to be introduced\n\n- **active point**: a structure indicates `active_node`, `active_value` and `offset`\n- **remainder**: remaining characters to be inserted\n\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n</br>\n\n### The first character => `a`\n\nWe append ` a ` directly to the root node\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1), states that we are going to insert a new node\n2. Append 'a' to the root node\n3. After the insertion, a new node is appended to the tree, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (1 - 1)\n4. After the whole procudure:\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-a.JPG)\n\n### The second character => `b`\n\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1), states that we are going to insert a new node\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'a' to 'ab'\n3. Query the current node, which is the root node, since there is no prefix starts with 'b', we need to create a new node and insert 'b'. (The prefix for the previous prefix will be [a, ab] now)\n3. After the insertion, a new node is appended to the tree, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (1 - 1)\n4. After the whole procudure:\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-ab.JPG)\n\n### The third character => `c`\n\nSame as the procedure of inserting 'b'\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abc](SuffixTree-Sample-abc.JPG)\n\n### The fourth character => `a` again\n\nThis time we encounter the same character we have already inserted\n1. Before we append the node, set `remainder = remainder + 1` (0 + 1)\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abc' -> 'abca', 'bc' -> 'bca', 'c' -> 'ca'\n3. Query the current node, which is the root node, find out the there already exist a prefix which starts from 'a'; hence we modify the `active_point`:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'a', 1)\nremainder = 1\n```\n> **active_node**: the parent node is still root node hence remain unchanged\n> **active_value**: the current value will be set to 'a'\n> **offset**: the offset of the current value, which is 1 (states the first character in the prefix)\n> **remainder** after the insertion, no new node is inserted in the tree, hence remainder keep the same (remainder = 1)\n\n\n### The fifth character => `b` again\n\nStill duplicated with previous nodes\n1. `remainder = remainder + 1` (1 + 1)\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abca' -> 'abcab', 'bca' -> 'bcab', 'ca' -> 'cab', `active_point[1] = 'a' -> 'ab'`\n3. Start from **active_node**, query the **active_value** in its prefix and the prefix of its sub-nodes. Modify **active_point** to the following:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'ab', 2)\nremainder = 2\n```\n> **active_node**: the active node is still root node hence remain unchanged.\n> **active_value**: the active value has been expended to 'ab'.\n> **offset**: 'ab' already exists in node 'ab' (which is the sub-node of root node), the offset of matched index is 2.\n> **remainder**: after the insertion, no new node is inserted in the tree, hence remainder keep the same\n\nBy this step, we still have the same amount of nodes inserted into the tree (3 nodes)\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcab](SuffixTree-Sample-abcab.JPG)\n\n### The sixth character => `x`\n\n1. `remainder = remainder + 1` (2 + 1).\n2. Expend every leave node; hence change 'abcab' -> 'abcabx', 'bcab' -> 'bcabx', 'cab' -> 'cabx', `active_point[1] = 'ab' -> 'abx'`.\n3. Start from **active_node**, query the **active_value** in its prefix and the prefix of its sub-nodes. Since there isn't a prefix which perfectly matches the pattern 'abx'; hence this is the point where to **split**:\n\n### Split\n\nWhen we find out the exact place where the prefix starts to mismatch the pattern, then we need to insert new nodes to our tree to append this new suffix character. For example, prefix 'abc' and pattern 'abx' share the same two characters 'ab' at the beginning and mismatch at the third character (offset = 3), then we can simply split at the third index to make a tree like 'ab' -> ['c', 'x']. We will do the same thing here:\n1. We already know the offset (which is active_point[2]).\n2. Split node **'abcabx' to 'ab' -> ['cabx', 'x']**.\n3. Modify **active_point** and **remainder**:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'bx', 1)\nremainder = 2\n```\n> **active_node**: still root node\n> **active_value**: 'abx' has been inserted, then we need to insert 'bx', then 'x' and so on so far\n> **offset**: active_point[1] changes from 'abx' to 'bx', then the offset will also shift from 2 to 1\n> **remainder**: a new node is inserted, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (3 - 1)\n>> **Why do we change offset as well?**\n>> This is actually a trick to reduce runtime. For each step of insertion, we will make an sub suffix tree by characters we already have (inserted). For example, if we have a string 'abc' and we have inserted the last character 'c' in the suffix tree, then all possible suffix of string (text) 'abc', which is 'abc', 'bc' and 'c' must exist in the suffix tree, either implicitly (have not splitted yet, like the fourth insertion above) or explicitly (has its own node). Hence, by inserting 'ab +x' and splitting the node, we know that 'b +x' must exist in the tree; therefore, we reduce the offset by 1 to state that the offset of the next split will start from the first character of the node 'b...'.\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx.JPG)\n4. The remainder is still greater than 0; hence we will keep inserting 'bx'. Do the same thing here, start from the **parent_node**, query the sub prefix 'bx'. Found 'bx' in the prefix 'bcabx'; hence split the node **'bcabx' to 'b' -> ['cabx', 'x']**\n5. Modify **active_point** and **remainder**:\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'x', 0)\nremainder = 1\n```\n> **active_node**: still root node\n> **active_value**: 'bx' has been inserted, then we need to insert 'x'\n> **offset**: active_point[1] changes from 'bx' to 'x', then the offset will also shift from 1 to 0\n> **remainder**: a new node is inserted, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (2 - 1)\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx - 2](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx-2.JPG)\n\n6. Since remainder is still greater than 0, we have to do another insertion to reduce it to zero. However, the character 'x' hasn't been inserted before, then we append 'x' directly to the root node.\n7. Modify **active_point** and **remainder**:\n```\nactive_point = (root, '', 0)\nremainder = 0\n```\n> **active_node**: still root node\n> **active_value**: the last character 'x' has been inserted, reduce to empty\n> **remainder**: a new node is inserted, hence `remainder = remainder - 1` (1- 1)\n\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx - 3](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx-3.JPG)\n\n**Is there a relationship between two splitted node `ab` and `b`?**\nWhen we separated 'ab' and 'b', we modified the previous 'abcabx' node first, then modified the second node 'bcabx'. If we encounter another string starting with 'abk', then after 'abk' is inserted, we definately need to insert 'bk' as well. Repeating the same query will slow down the whole procedure; thus, we can add a link from 'ab' to 'b' to indicate that if an update is made in node 'ab', then another insertion will be done on the link target 'b' afterwards.\n![Sample \"abcabx\" -- abcabx - 4](SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx-4.JPG)\n\n### The seventh character => `a`\n\nSame as the fourth insertion 'a'\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'a', 1)\nremainder = 1\n```\n\n### The eighth character = `b`\n\nSame as the fifth insertion 'b'\n```\nactive_point = (root, 'ab', 2)\nremainder = 2\n```\n\n### The ninth character => `c`\n\nWhen we try to insert 'c'\n1. `remainder= remainder + 1` (3)\n2.

For each step of insertion, we will make an sub suffix tree by characters we already have (inserted). For example, if we have a string ‘abc’ and we have inserted the last character ‘c’ in the suffix tree, then all possible suffix of string (text) ‘abc’, which is ‘abc’, ‘bc’ and ‘c’ must exist in the suffix tree, either implicitly (have not splitted yet, like the fourth insertion above) or explicitly (has its own node). Hence, by inserting ‘ab +x’ and splitting the node, we know that ‘b +x’ must exist in the tree; therefore, we reduce the offset by 1 to state that the offset of the next split will start from the first character of the node ‘b…’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx.JPG\" alt=\"Sample &quot;abcabx&quot; -- abcabx\"></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The remainder is still greater than 0; hence we will keep inserting ‘bx’.

A compressed prefix tree, also called <strong>Compressed Tire</strong> is the fundamental of suffix tree. Besides, the key values stored in each nodes of a suffix tree is all the possible suffix.</p>\n<p>For example, for a single word (<strong>Text</strong>) <code>banana\\0</code>, we have the following set of suffix:</p>\n<pre><code>banana\\0\nanana\\0\nnana\\0\nana\\0\nna\\0\na\\0\n\\0\n</code></pre><p>Construct a prefix tree using the above key words:<br><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/Banana_PrefixTree.JPG\" alt=\"Banana Prefix Tree\"><br>Afterwards, compress it:<br><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/Banana_SuffixTree.JPG\" alt=\"Banana Suffix Tree\"><br>Here, by lising all the suffix and making a compressed prefix tree, we obtain a suffix tree.</p>\n<p>However, there is a faster way to construct a suffix tree which can be done in the linear time (By Esko Ukkonen in 1997).

Start from the first character <code>a</code>, construct an edge from root node to its leaf:<br><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/PrefixTree_a.JPG\" alt=\"Sample &quot;abc&quot; -- a\"><br>Where [0, #] represents start from offset 0 and end up at offset #.

Since there isn’t a prefix which perfectly matches the pattern ‘abx’; hence this is the point where to <strong>split</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Split\"><a href=\"#Split\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Split\"></a>Split</h3><p>When we find out the exact place where the prefix starts to mismatch the pattern, then we need to insert new nodes to our tree to append this new suffix character. For example, prefix ‘abc’ and pattern ‘abx’ share the same two characters ‘ab’ at the beginning and mismatch at the third character (offset = 3), then we can simply split at the third index to make a tree like ‘ab’ -&gt; [‘c’, ‘x’]. We will do the same thing here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We already know the offset (which is active_point[2]).</li>\n<li>Split node <strong>‘abcabx’ to ‘ab’ -&gt; [‘cabx’, ‘x’]</strong>.</li>\n<li>Modify <strong>active_point</strong> and <strong>remainder</strong>:<pre><code>active_point = (root, &#39;bx&#39;, 1)\nremainder = 2\n</code></pre><blockquote>\n<p><strong>active_node</strong>: still root node<br><strong>active_value</strong>: ‘abx’ has been inserted, then we need to insert ‘bx’, then ‘x’ and so on so far<br><strong>offset</strong>: active_point[1] changes from ‘abx’ to ‘bx’, then the offset will also shift from 2 to 1<br><strong>remainder</strong>: a new node is inserted, hence <code>remainder = remainder - 1</code> (3 - 1)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why do we change offset as well?</strong><br>This is actually a trick to reduce runtime. For each step of insertion, we will make an sub suffix tree by characters we already have (inserted). For example, if we have a string ‘abc’ and we have inserted the last character ‘c’ in the suffix tree, then all possible suffix of string (text) ‘abc’, which is ‘abc’, ‘bc’ and ‘c’ must exist in the suffix tree, either implicitly (have not splitted yet, like the fourth insertion above) or explicitly (has its own node). Hence, by inserting ‘ab +x’ and splitting the node, we know that ‘b +x’ must exist in the tree; therefore, we reduce the offset by 1 to state that the offset of the next split will start from the first character of the node ‘b…’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx.JPG\" alt=\"Sample &quot;abcabx&quot; -- abcabx\"></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The remainder is still greater than 0; hence we will keep inserting ‘bx’. Do the same thing here, start from the <strong>parent_node</strong>, query the sub prefix ‘bx’. Found ‘bx’ in the prefix ‘bcabx’; hence split the node <strong>‘bcabx’ to ‘b’ -&gt; [‘cabx’, ‘x’]</strong></li>\n<li>Modify <strong>active_point</strong> and <strong>remainder</strong>:<pre><code>active_point = (root, &#39;x&#39;, 0)\nremainder = 1\n</code></pre><blockquote>\n<p><strong>active_node</strong>: still root node<br><strong>active_value</strong>: ‘bx’ has been inserted, then we need to insert ‘x’<br><strong>offset</strong>: active_point[1] changes from ‘bx’ to ‘x’, then the offset will also shift from 1 to 0<br><strong>remainder</strong>: a new node is inserted, hence <code>remainder = remainder - 1</code> (2 - 1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/2019/07/22/Suffix-Tree/SuffixTree-Sample-abcabx-2.JPG\" alt=\"Sample &quot;abcabx&quot; -- abcabx - 2\"></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Since remainder is still greater than 0, we have to do another insertion to reduce it to zero.

They are really similar but providing different means of working with sequences of typed data. So to understand slices we must first understand arrays.<!-- more -->\n</br>\n\n## Arrays in Go\nAn array in Go has to specify its **length** and **element type**. **The size of the array is fixed and its length is part of its type**. For example `[4]int` and `[5]int` are distinct and have different types even though they all store integers. And contrary to **C/C++**, the initial value of an array will be filled with **0** if it is not initialized.\n```Go\nvar a [4]int\na[0] = 1\ni := a[0]\nj := a[1]\n//i == 1\n//j == 0\n```\nGo's arrays are values. **An array variable denotes the entire array**; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C/C++). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents. (To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then that's a pointer to an array, not an array)\n\nAn array literal can be specified like so:\n```Go\nb := [2]string{\"aa\", \"bb\"}\n```\nOr, you can have the compiler counting the array elements for you:\n```Go\nb := [...]string{\"aa\", \"bb\"}\n```\nIn both cases, the type of b is **[2]string**.\n</br>\n\n## Slices in Go\nArrays are a bit inflexible, so you don't see them too often in the code. Slices, though, are everywhere. Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specific length:\n```Go\nb := []string{\"aa\", \"bb\"}\n```\nWe can use build-in function `make()` to define a slice:\n```Go\nfunc make([]T, len, cap) []T\n```\n**T** represent the type of the elements. Function **make** accepts type, length and capacity(optional) as parameters. When it is called, **make** will allocate an array and returns a slice that refers to that array\n```Go\nvar s []byte\ns = make([]byte, 5, 5)\n//s == []byte{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\n```\nIf **cap** is not specified, it will be init as the value of **len**. We can use the build-in functions `len()` and `cap()` to check the length and capacity of a slice:\n```Go\nlen(s) == 5\ncap(s) == 5\n```\nThe zero value of a slice is **nil**. The len and cap functions will both return **0** for a nil slice.\n\nA slice can also be formed by \"slicing\" an existing slice or array, for example, the expression b[1:4] creates a slice including elements 1 through 3 of b:\n```Go\nb := []byte{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'}\n// b[1:4] == []byte{'b', 'c', 'd'}, sharing the same storage as b\n```\nThe start and end indices of a slice expression are optional; they default to zero and the slice's length respectively:\n```Go\n// b[:2] == []byte{'a', 'b'}\n// b[2:] == []byte{'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'}\n// b[:] == b\n```\nThis is also the syntax to create a slice given an array:\n```Go\nx := [3]string{\"Лайка\", \"Белка\", \"Стрелка\"}\ns := x[:] // a slice referencing the storage of x\n```\n\nSlicing does not copy the slice's data. It creates a new slice value that points to the original array. This makes slice operations as efficient as manipulating array indices. Therefore, modifying the elements of a re-slice modifies the elements of the original slice:\n```Go\nd := []byte{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\ne := d[2:]\n// e == []byte{'c', 'd'}\n\n// now change the re-slice will also change the original slice  \ne[1] = 'm'\n// e == []byte{'c', 'm'}\n// d == []byte{'a', 'b', 'c', 'm'}\n```\nA slice cannot be grown beyond its capacity. Attempting to do so will cause a ***runtime panic***, just as when indexing outside the bounds of a slice or array. Similarly, slices cannot be re-sliced below zero to access earlier elements in the array.\n</br>\n\n## Double the capacity of a slice\nTo increase the capacity of a slice, we must create a new, larger slice and **copy** the contents of the original slice into it. The belowing example shows how to create a new slice **t** whihc doubles the capacity of **s**:\n```Go\nt := make([]byte, len(s), (cap(s) * 2))\nfor i:= range s {\n    t[i] = s[i]\n}\ns = t   //reassign s to t\n```\nThe loop can be replaced by the build-in function `copy()`, which copies the data from source and returns the number of elements copied:\n```Go\nfunc copy(dst, src []T) int\n```\nThe function **copy** supports copying between slices of different lengths (it will copy only up to the smaller number of elements) and the case that two slices refer to the same array. Using **copy**, the above double size code snippet can be rewritten as:\n```Go\nt := make([]byte, len(s), (cap(s) * 2))\ncopy(t, s)\ns = t\n```\nA common operation is to append new data to the tail of a slice:\n```Go\nfunc AppendByte(slice []byte, data ...type) []byte {\n    m := len(slice)\n    n := m + len(data)\n    if n > cap(slice) { //if the original capacity is not big enough     \n        newSlice := make([]byte, (n + 1) * 2)\n        copy(newSlice, slice)\n        slice = newSlice\n    }\n    slice = slice[0:n] //shrink the capacity to the length of data  \n    copy(slice[m:n], data)\n    return slice\n}\n```\nThis customized AppendByte function is really useful because we can fully control the size of a slice. However most programs do need such complete control. Go provides a build-in function `append()` which appends slice x to the end of slice s, expanding s if needed:\n```Go\nfunc append(s []T, x ...T) []T\n```\nUsing **...** to append one slice to the end of another:\n```Go\na := []string{\"aa\", \"bb\"}\nb := []string{\"cc\", \"dd\"}\na = append(a, b...) //same as append(a, b[0], b[1], b[2])   \n```\nAnother example of append:\n```Go\nfunc Filter(s []int, fn func(int) bool) []int {\n    var p []int // p == nil\n    for _, v := range s {\n        if fn(v) {\n            p = append(p, v)\n        }\n    }\n    return p\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Type-slice-in-Golang.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Slice in Golang\ndate: 2019-05-12 15:35:54\ntags: [Golang, Array, Slice]\nphotos: [\"../images/GoSlice.JPG\"]\n---\nThis article is a summary from [Andrew Gerrand's blog](https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals)\n\nGolang has an unique type **slice** which is an abstraction built on top of Go's **array** type.

They are really similar but providing different means of working with sequences of typed data. So to understand slices we must first understand arrays.</p>","more":"<br><br><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"Arrays-in-Go\"><a href=\"#Arrays-in-Go\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Arrays in Go\"></a>Arrays in Go</h2><p>An array in Go has to specify its <strong>length</strong> and <strong>element type</strong>. <strong>The size of the array is fixed and its length is part of its type</strong>. For example <code>[4]int</code> and <code>[5]int</code> are distinct and have different types even though they all store integers. And contrary to <strong>C/C++</strong>, the initial value of an array will be filled with <strong>0</strong> if it is not initialized.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">var a [4]int\na[0] = 1\ni := a[0]\nj := a[1]\n//i == 1\n//j == 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Go’s arrays are values. <strong>An array variable denotes the entire array</strong>; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C/C++). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents. (To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then that’s a pointer to an array, not an array)</p>\n<p>An array literal can be specified like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">b := [2]string{&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, you can have the compiler counting the array elements for you:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">b := [...]string{&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In both cases, the type of b is <strong>[2]string</strong>.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Slices-in-Go\"><a href=\"#Slices-in-Go\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Slices in Go\"></a>Slices in Go</h2><p>Arrays are a bit inflexible, so you don’t see them too often in the code. Slices, though, are everywhere. Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specific length:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">b := []string{&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can use build-in function <code>make()</code> to define a slice:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">func make([]T, len, cap) []T\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>T</strong> represent the type of the elements. Function <strong>make</strong> accepts type, length and capacity(optional) as parameters. When it is called, <strong>make</strong> will allocate an array and returns a slice that refers to that array</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">var s []byte\ns = make([]byte, 5, 5)\n//s == []byte{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If <strong>cap</strong> is not specified, it will be init as the value of <strong>len</strong>. We can use the build-in functions <code>len()</code> and <code>cap()</code> to check the length and capacity of a slice:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">len(s) == 5\ncap(s) == 5\n</code></pre>\n<p>The zero value of a slice is <strong>nil</strong>. The len and cap functions will both return <strong>0</strong> for a nil slice.</p>\n<p>A slice can also be formed by “slicing” an existing slice or array, for example, the expression b[1:4] creates a slice including elements 1 through 3 of b:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">b := []byte{&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;}\n// b[1:4] == []byte{&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;}, sharing the same storage as b\n</code></pre>\n<p>The start and end indices of a slice expression are optional; they default to zero and the slice’s length respectively:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">// b[:2] == []byte{&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;}\n// b[2:] == []byte{&#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;}\n// b[:] == b\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is also the syntax to create a slice given an array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">x := [3]string{&quot;Лайка&quot;, &quot;Белка&quot;, &quot;Стрелка&quot;}\ns := x[:] // a slice referencing the storage of x\n</code></pre>\n<p>Slicing does not copy the slice’s data. It creates a new slice value that points to the original array. This makes slice operations as efficient as manipulating array indices. Therefore, modifying the elements of a re-slice modifies the elements of the original slice:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"Go\">d := []byte{&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;}\ne := d[2:]\n// e == []byte{&#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;}\n\n// now change the re-slice will also change the original slice  \ne[1] = &#39;m&#39;\n// e == []byte{&#39;c&#39;, &#39;m&#39;}\n// d == []byte{&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;m&#39;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A slice cannot be grown beyond its capacity. Attempting to do so will cause a <strong><em>runtime panic</em></strong>, just as when indexing outside the bounds of a slice or array. Similarly, slices cannot be re-sliced below zero to access earlier elements in the array.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Double-the-capacity-of-a-slice\"><a href=\"#Double-the-capacity-of-a-slice\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Double the capacity of a slice\"></a>Double the capacity of a slice</h2><p>To increase the capacity of a slice, we must create a new, larger slice and <strong>copy</strong> the contents of the original slice into it.
